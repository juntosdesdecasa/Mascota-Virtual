# Mascota-Virtual
Workshop for "Juntos desde casa" in which you create your own virtual pet by coding in Python. You can see the video in the iniciative youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM_iMXEGtSI
The workshop has been made based in coding IDE repl.it where you can write your code without registering, although my recommendation is to create your user count for saving your python projects.
